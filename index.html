    <p>Our game structure is divided into modules, when j1Module is the main module that shares awake, preupdate, update, postupdate and cleanup functions of all other modules. App is the module that calls the previous functions to be used by a certain module. One special mention is that we have 2 modules called j1EntityManager and j1GUI that manages all entity and UI submodules.</p>
